	<h2>My Guide To Gameplay And Winning</h2>

	<h3>Season 7 is here and the battle bus is dropping players like crazy!
	 The most popular area is (of course) Tilted Towers and if you are a good player you could probably drop about 8-12 kills there.
	 If you wanted to get a sure-fire win you could probably go to Lonley Lodge and rotate to "The Block" to get some extra loot or you could go to one of the plane sites
	and grab a plane to soar above your enemies for most of the match. If you wanted a high kill game and win, you could go to Retail Row and pick off people with your AR
	 (Assault Rifle). My favourite place to land is the diner near Dusty Divot where you can get good loot and encounter only 0-2 enemies and then you can go down into
	 Dusty Divot and get lots of wood from trees to build.</h3>

	<h2 id="weaponcombos">Weapon Combos</h2>

	<h3>Weapon Combos are 2 or more weapons combined to make a huge impact on the enemy. Different combos are used for: different situations, different ranges, and 
	different players. Here are some lists for different weapon combos:</h3>
	
	<h4>Close Range Combos</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>Shotgun (first) SMG (second)</li>
		<li>Deagle (first) Shotgun (second)</li>
		<li>Shotgun (first) AR (second)</li> 

	</ul>

	<h4>Medium Range Combos</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>Sniper (first) AR (second)</li>
		<li>AR (first) RPG (make sure you shoot the RPG on the grown near the enemy) (second)</li>
		<li>RPG (first) Sniper (second)</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Long Range Combos</h4>

	<p>Coming Soon!</p>

	<h3>You might be wondering, "why do the weapons repeat?" Well respectable reader, some weapons are universal like an AR or some weapons do not have any bloom.</h3>

	<h2 id="loadout">Your loadout and where each weapon should be positioned</h2>
	
	<h3>So usually most people think that their inventory order does not matter, actually, it controls about 20% of your gaming experience (unless you are on a PC which you
	 need to make the correct key binds). If you are on a console (PS4, Xbox, or Nintendo Switch) you will probably do some combo to eliminate an enemy, and if your weapon is 
	in the wrong spot you will switch to the wrong weapon and get eliminated instead of eliminating the enemy. And so I have made the perfect order for your loadout.</h3>

	<h2 id="rarities">Rarities</h2>

	<h3>Rarities are different ranks of weapons determining how good the weapon is. For example, you have just eliminated an enemy and looting them. You have a epic (purple)
	 heavy shotgun but your has a legendary (gold) heavy shotgun. The weapon is the same but the rarity is different. Since legenday weapons do more damage you should always
	 choose legendary above other rarities.</h3>

	<h2 id="themap">The Map</h2>

	<h3>Incase you don't know, the map is the layout of all the destinations of the map. The map hotkey shows the map in birds eye view so you can place your marker. On the map, there are lots of
	 different places. </h3>

	<h3>As you see above, the map is large and has more than twenty named locations and more to come! Also, recently for the winter update, a new biome has been added. The new biome 
	is (obviously) the snow biome. The snow biome has also come with new locations like Polar Peak and Happy Hamlet.</h3>
